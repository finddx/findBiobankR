}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table object.}

\item{numeric_var}{The name of the numeric variable to evaluate against the threshold.
This should be provided as a character string.}

\item{threshold}{The numeric threshold to separate the rows.

\description{
This function takes a data.table, a numeric variable name, and a threshold.
It separates the rows into those above and below the threshold. Rows above
the threshold are shuffled. The function then combines these shuffled rows
with the unshuffled rows below the threshold, maintaining the original order
where possible.
